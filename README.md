What is it?
Done in a few hours over a couple of weekends (actually one and did docs later) for our Dev Huddle. Wanted to develop a simple example to use as a starting point to explore React Native, ES6 and use Firebase. Cobbled a lot of code from the web.

What do I need to setup my dev env?
* Basic dev setup (Sublime, Chrome Dev tools, iOS Simulator, node, npm)

Where do I start?
* https://facebook.github.io/react-native/
* https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup (free account)
* and there are tons of other free learning guides on the web
